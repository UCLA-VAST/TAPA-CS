The source code of this design is synthesized by the TAPA compiler (https://github.com/Blaok/tapa), which provides useful extension to Vivado HLS

- To run AutoBridge:
  - `./run_autobridge.sh`

- To run Vitis, we have to first package the results using the TAPA compiler. We provided the XO that has already been packaged (`PageRank_FP1.xo`) if you do not have TAPA already installed. 
  - `./run_vitis.sh`

- To verify that the provided XO is the same as generated by AutoBridge, you could unzip the XO to check the contents
  - `unzip PageRank_FP1.xo`

Note that each module whose name contains "Mem" will interact with the HBM controller, thus their location should be explicitly specified.
